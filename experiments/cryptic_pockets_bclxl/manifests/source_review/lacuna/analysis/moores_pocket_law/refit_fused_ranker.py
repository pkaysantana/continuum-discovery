"""The fused pool is better. Can a ranker that has seen it exploit that?

`end_to_end_fusion.py` measured the surface detector through the whole pipeline
on 747 train-fold targets. Fusing it with the alpha detector raises coverage
from 65.7% to 81.7%, +15.9 [+13.3, +18.7], and costs top-five recovery:
-4.3 [-7.8, -0.7], with the interval clear of zero. More sites are found and
fewer are returned.

That is the decoy-injection result again, arriving from the other direction.
Injecting competitors drawn from the wrong-answer score distribution cost 17
points; removing low-scoring candidates at random bought nothing; and now
adding candidates the shipped ranker was never fitted on costs 4.3. In every
case what hurts is wrong answers the ranker scores highly, which is exactly
what a surface candidate is to a model fitted only on alpha-detector features.

So the question is whether the loss is intrinsic to a bigger pool or an
artefact of the ranker never having seen one. This refits on the fused pool and
compares four orderings of candidates already computed:

    alpha pool, shipped ranker     the current product
    fused pool, shipped ranker     what shipping the detector would do today
    fused pool, refit ranker       same candidates, ranker cross-fitted on them
    fused pool, refit + provenance the same, plus which detectors found the site

Provenance is worth testing on its own. A cluster both detectors independently
proposed is a different object from one only the surface model liked, and the
shipped feature set has no way to say so.

Nothing is re-run: `end_to_end_fusion.jsonl` already carries every candidate's
27 ranker features, its Jaccard and its detector sources. Cross-fitting is
leave-one-fold-out over the four homology-separated training folds.

Protocol: train folds only. The designated test fold is never read here.
