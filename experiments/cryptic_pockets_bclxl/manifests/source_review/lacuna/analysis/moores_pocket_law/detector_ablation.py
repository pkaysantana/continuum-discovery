"""Is the ensemble machinery worth anything independent of the detector?

Every number Lacuna reports confounds two things it does at once: it proposes
candidates with its own alpha-sphere detector, and it runs those candidates
through an ensemble, a cross-conformer clusterer and a fitted ranker. Nothing
published separates them, so "Lacuna recovers 55.6%" leaves the interesting
question unanswered. If the second half is a general amplifier, it should lift
someone else's detector too. If it only works on candidates its own detector
produces, that is a much narrower claim and worth knowing before someone else
finds out first.

The design is 2x2, detector crossed with mode:

    p2rank-static      P2Rank on the input structure, P2Rank's own ranking.
                       This is the published tool, used exactly as shipped.
    p2rank-ensemble    P2Rank run per conformer, then Lacuna's clusterer and
                       fitted ranker. Same candidates, Lacuna's machinery.
    lacuna-static      Alpha detector on the input structure only, n=1.
    lacuna-ensemble    The shipped configuration.

The comparison that answers the question is the first pair. The second pair is
the control: it says how much the machinery is worth on the detector it was
built around, so the two lifts can be read side by side.

One honest caveat, stated here because the numbers cannot be read without it.
The fitted ranker's features include volume dynamics, persistence and
crypticity, all of which degenerate when there is one conformer. The static
arms are therefore ranked by what their own method offers: P2Rank by its
learned probability, and the alpha detector by analytic druggability. That is
the fair comparison (each method as it would actually be used) but it is not a
clean single-variable manipulation, and lacuna-static should not be read as
"the ranker without the ensemble".

Protocol: train folds only. The designated test fold is never read here.
