"""Can a learned surface scorer find the sites the geometry filter throws away?

`pool_density.py` moved the problem. Among covered targets the ranker already
puts the true site first 57.3% of the time and inside the top five 86.3% of the
time, so ranking is not where Lacuna's remaining loss lives. Coverage is: the
alpha detector proposes nothing qualifying on 27.7% of train-fold targets,
while union coverage across detectors reaches 92.2%. Roughly twenty points sit
in candidates other detectors find and this one does not.

The alpha detector only proposes at concavities. Anything shallow, flat, or not
yet open is discarded before ranking ever sees it. A learned scorer over
surface points has no such filter: it proposes wherever the model says
ligandable. That is what P2Rank does, and porting P2Rank is not the interesting
version of this, because the geometry engine here already computes most of what
such a scorer needs. `_GridContext` gives distance to nearest atom, local
density, and bulk_depth (how deeply a voxel is recessed, measured against a
rolling-probe definition of bulk solvent) for every voxel, once per conformer.

So this trains a point classifier on those fields plus physicochemical
aggregates, and asks one question, on the population that matters:

    On targets where the alpha detector currently has ZERO qualifying
    candidate, does a learned scorer put a cluster at the annotated site?

Only that subset is scored. Improving targets that already work is not the
question, and averaging over all targets would hide the answer.

Two things keep this honest. Cross-fitting is leave-one-fold-out over
CryptoBench's four homology-separated train folds, so no structure is scored by
a model trained on its homologues. And proposed clusters are characterised by
``characterize_pockets``, Lacuna's own code, so the residue sets compared
against the annotation are on exactly the scale every other number uses.

Protocol: train folds only. The designated test fold is never read here.
