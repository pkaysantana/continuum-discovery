"""Fit and validate the learned pocket ranker used by ``rank_by="learned"``.

Why a learned ranker exists
---------------------------
Measured on shuffled CryptoBench structures (NMA, 20 conformers, top-5,
size-robust Jaccard >= 0.25), recovery is lost at the ranking stage, not at
sampling or detection:

    best over top-5 ranked clusters   12.7%   <- what Lacuna reported
    best over ANY cluster (oracle)    75.3%
    best over ANY raw pocket          81.3%
    picking 5 clusters at random      13.0%

There is a median of 64 clusters per structure and typically exactly 1 of them is
correct, so the analytic scores were performing at chance. This script fits a
linear model to tell the correct cluster from the rest.

Protocol
--------
The split follows CryptoBench's OWN folds: fitted on train-0..train-3, reported
on the designated test fold. Those folds exist to separate homologous proteins,
so a naive random or hash split can place homologs on both sides and inflate the
held-out estimate. Every reported number carries a target-level bootstrap CI, and
a shuffled-label control is fitted identically to confirm the gain is signal
rather than an artifact of the evaluation.

Standardization is folded into the exported weights so Lacuna scores pockets with
a plain dot product and needs no scikit-learn at runtime; scikit-learn is required
only to run this script.

Usage
-----
    python benchmarks/train_ranker.py --dump features.jsonl --limit 400   # collect
    python benchmarks/train_ranker.py --dump features.jsonl --fit         # fit + report
