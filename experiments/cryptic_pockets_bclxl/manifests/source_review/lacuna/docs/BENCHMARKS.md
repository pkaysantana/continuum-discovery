# Benchmarks: full detail

Per-target breakdowns, ablations and timings behind the headline results in the
[README](../README.md#benchmarks). Every number here is reproducible with the
command shown; each benchmark script prints the full per-metric breakdown
(centroid, Jaccard at 0.20/0.25/0.30, and legacy recall) when you run it.

Unless stated otherwise: NMA backend, 20 conformers, the default `learned`
ranker, top-5, and the size-robust criterion (Jaccard ≥ 0.25 **or** centroid
≤ 4 Å).

## Independent validation

Default `learned` strategy, with the optional PLM-assisted ranker in the last
column.

| Benchmark | N | `learned` (default) | Legacy recall | `learned-plm` | Notes |
|-----------|--:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|-------|
| CryptoBench (designated test fold) | 180 | **55.6%** | 77% | **66.1%** | largest and most diverse; the headline |
| PocketMiner | 45 | **73%** (33/45) | 84% | **80%** (36/45) | per-residue cryptic labels |
| Curated apo/holo set (this repo) | 22 | **45%** (10/22) | 68% | 41% (9/22) | hand-picked literature cryptic pairs |
| COACH420 | 286 | **87%** (248/286) | 93% | not measured | *general* holo sites, not cryptic |

COACH420 appears twice in this document with two different denominators, and
both are correct. This table reports Lacuna standing alone, so it uses every
structure Lacuna scored: 248/286. The head-to-head against P2Rank below, under
"COACH420: general binding sites, and where Lacuna's specialisation shows",
pairs the two tools on the 144 structures *both* of them scored, because an
unpaired comparison would let a difference in which structures each tool
happened to handle masquerade as a difference in the tools. The rate is the same
either way (86.8% paired, 86.7% standalone); the larger denominator only narrows
the interval, from 95% CI [80.2, 91.9] to [82.2, 90.4].

With `--detector surface-fusion` the same 287-structure COACH420 run reaches
**96.5%** (277/287, 95% CI [93.7, 98.3]), against 86.7% for the default `alpha`
detector. That detector is not the default and is not folded into the table
above, which reports the zero-dependency default throughout.

On the curated 22 the default edges out the PLM-assisted ranker, 10/22 against
9/22. At that sample size the difference is one structure and means nothing on
its own, but it is a reminder that the PLM-assisted ranker's advantage is
established on CryptoBench and does not automatically transfer.

Datasets: PocketMiner (Meller et al. 2023, *Nat. Commun.*); CryptoBench (Škrhák
et al. 2025, *Bioinformatics*). The CryptoBench split follows the dataset's own
homology-separated folds, and the ranker's coefficients were fitted on the train
folds only; no test-fold example entered that fit. The tool as a whole has been
developed over many iterations during which test-fold performance was measured,
so these are designated held-out numbers rather than a claim of full blindness.

The curated 22-target set is the hardest of the three despite being the
smallest: it was assembled from published cryptic-pocket case studies and is
deliberately enriched for the large-motion sites this pipeline handles worst.

### Reproducing these numbers

```bash
python benchmarks/cryptic_benchmark.py --category cryptic     # curated set (~4 min)
python benchmarks/pocketminer_benchmark.py                    # PocketMiner (auto-downloads)
python benchmarks/cryptobench_benchmark.py                    # CryptoBench test fold (~10 min)
python benchmarks/compare_detectors_cryptobench.py --analyze  # the head-to-head table
python benchmarks/compare_mdpocket.py --folds test            # vs MDpocket (needs mdpocket on PATH)
python benchmarks/verify_recall_gaming.py                     # why Jaccard, not recall
```

## Success criterion

A pocket counts as recovered if, among the top five ranked clusters, one's lining
residues reach a **Jaccard overlap >= 0.25** with the known ligand-contact site
(Jaccard = |found and known| / |found or known|), **or** its centre lies within
4 A of the site centroid. Lining residues use a true atomic-contact definition:
any residue with an atom within 5 A of the detected cavity.

Recall is deliberately not the headline. It is size-gameable: a large pocket
engulfs a small known site and scores high recall while sitting nowhere near it.
Ordering candidates by volume alone reaches 77.7% under a recall threshold of
0.30 but only 52.0% under Jaccard at 0.25, and the learned ranker scores 77.7%
under recall as well, so measured that way it is indistinguishable from sorting
by size (`benchmarks/verify_recall_gaming.py`). Both numbers print side by side
in every benchmark script.

## Head-to-head: four detectors, one criterion

CryptoBench's held-out test fold. MDpocket receives the **same NMA ensemble**
Lacuna uses, so that row isolates detection, aggregation and ranking rather than
the sampler. fpocket and P2Rank are single-structure tools and see the apo
structure, which is their intended usage.

All rows paired on the same 180 structures, and every Lacuna number
re-measured end to end after the last change to the ranker weights. An earlier
revision of this table mixed measurements taken days apart, which is why the
figures moved slightly.

| Detector | Size-robust top-5 | Legacy recall | Paired vs `learned-plm` |
|----------|:-----------------:|:-------------:|-----------------------------|
| **Lacuna** (`learned-plm`) | **66.1% (119/180)** | 82% | - |
| P2Rank | 63.3% (114/180) | 82% | +2.8% CI[-4.4, +9.4], includes zero |
| **Lacuna** (`learned`, default) | **55.6% (100/180)** | 77% | +10.6% CI[+6.1, +15.0] |
| MDpocket (best of 10 configs) | 43.9% (79/180) | - | +22.2% CI[+14.4, +30.0] |
| fpocket | 43.6% (78/179) | 32% | +22.9% CI[+14.5, +31.3] |

The PLM-assisted ranker is level with P2Rank: the interval on the difference spans
zero, so parity is the claim, not a win.

**The default trails P2Rank by 7.8 points (CI -15.0 to -0.6, excluding zero.)**
That is a change from what this file said previously. Before the
conformer-invariant refit the default scored 56.7% with a wider interval that
included zero, and it was described as indistinguishable from P2Rank. Refitting
cost about a point and tightened the interval, so the difference is now
resolvable and the earlier description no longer holds. The default still beats
MDpocket by +11.7% (CI +3.9 to +19.4) and fpocket by +12.3%.

### Cohort note: 180 here, 178 in the preprint

Every figure on this page uses all 180 CryptoBench test-fold structures,
which is the right cohort for evaluating the software on its own. The
companion preprint compares four detectors and therefore keeps only the 178
structures on which all four produced output, so that every comparison is
paired. The PLM-assisted ranker scores **66.1% (119/180)** here and **66.3%
(118/178, 95% CI 59.0-73.0)** there. Same configuration, slightly different
set, not a change in the software.

Union of `learned-plm` and P2Rank: 76.1%, with 23 structures recovered by Lacuna
alone. Union of all five detectors: 79.4%. The tools remain complementary.

MDpocket is the closest relative of this work and the fair ensemble baseline. It
emits an occupancy grid rather than a ranked list, so its intended workflow is
visual inspection at a chosen isovalue. Benchmarking it requires thresholding
that grid, grouping the surviving voxels into pockets and ranking them. Because
that adaptation is ours and not the tool's, the isovalue and ranking rule were
swept and its **best** configuration is reported. Its default isovalue of 0.5
scores 40.2%; the most permissive setting tried (0.2) collapses to 33.0%, the
same over-merging failure described under
[clustering radius](#why-the-clustering-radius-is-2-å).

```bash
python benchmarks/compare_detectors_cryptobench.py --tools lacuna_learned --tag learned --folds test
python benchmarks/compare_detectors_cryptobench.py --analyze
python benchmarks/compare_mdpocket.py --folds test     # needs mdpocket on PATH
```

## Curated cryptic set: 10 / 22

Hand-assembled from published cryptic-pocket case studies, and the hardest of
the three benchmarks despite being the smallest: it is deliberately enriched for
the large-motion sites this pipeline handles worst.

| Metric | `learned` (default) | `learned-plm` |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Size-robust (Jaccard ≥ 0.25 or centroid ≤ 4 Å) | **10/22 (45%)** | 9/22 (41%) |
| Legacy recall (≥ 30% or centroid ≤ 4 Å) | 15/22 (68%) | - |

The default edges out the PLM-assisted ranker here by a single structure, the
opposite ordering to CryptoBench. One structure at n=22 means nothing by itself,
but it is worth stating that the PLM-assisted ranker's advantage is established on
CryptoBench and does not automatically carry over.

### By opening mechanism

Coarse literature labels for the dominant motion that opens each site.

| Mechanism | Recovered | Misses |
|-----------|:---------:|--------|
| sidechain | 2/4 | 1M47, 1HMV |
| loop | 2/6 | 1NB4, 2ERK, 2OZR, 1RTC |
| helix | 3/7 | 3CS9, 1LXL, 1G5M, 1JWP |
| hinge | 1/2 | 1V4S |
| interface | 1/3 | 2HBQ, 1ZJH |

Hinge and interface sites were previously 0/2 and 0/3; both now recover one
target. They remain the weakest classes, which is expected: a harmonic
elastic-network ensemble cannot generate large inter-domain or inter-subunit
motions. Dimer-interface pockets are partly addressable with `--homodimer`
(reads BIOMT records and builds the biological assembly), though this
benchmark's single-chain-referenced scoring does not credit them.

```bash
python benchmarks/cryptic_benchmark.py --category cryptic
python benchmarks/cryptic_benchmark.py --category cryptic --top-n 20   # detection ceiling
```

## Ranking strategies

`--rank-by` on the curated 22-target cryptic set:

| Strategy | Description | Curated 22 |
|----------|-------------|:----------:|
| `persistence` | legacy persistence × druggability | **13/22 (59%)** |
| `balanced` | druggability with a mild persistence bonus | **13/22 (59%)** |
| `druggability` | peak open-state composite druggability | 11/22 (50%) |
| `learned` (default) | fitted linear ranker over 23 features | 10/22 (45%) |
| `crypticity` | most cryptic sites first (previous default) | 7/22 (32%) |

**The default is not the winner here, and that is worth stating plainly.** On
CryptoBench's test fold (n=180) `learned` recovers 55.6% against 17.8% for
`crypticity`, an interval-separated gap on the largest and most diverse
benchmark, which is why it ships as the default. On this 22-target set the
ordering reverses. At n=22 the confidence intervals overlap heavily
(`persistence` [41%, 77%] vs `learned` [23%, 68%]), so the two results are not
formally in conflict, but the honest reading is that the learned ranker is tuned
to CryptoBench's distribution while the analytic rules do better on the classic
literature targets. If your proteins resemble the latter, try
`--rank-by persistence`.

## Orthosteric / conformational controls

| Category | Result | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Orthosteric | 4/6 | lysozyme, HIV-1 protease, DHFR, HIF-2α (1.0 Å centroid); misses thrombin, trypsin (1S0Q numbering) |
| Conformational | 0/1 | adenylate kinase open→closed |

Orthosteric recovery improved from 3/6. The single conformational target
(adenylate kinase) regressed from 1/1: it is an always-open active site that the
finer clustering radius now splits. With n=1 this is an anecdote rather than a
trend, but it is reported rather than dropped.

## COACH420: general binding sites, and where Lacuna's specialisation shows

COACH420 is a **general** ligand binding-site set of **holo** structures: the
ligand is present and the pocket is already open. It measures a different task
from the rest of this suite, and it is the direct answer to the reasonable
objection that Lacuna had only been measured on CryptoBench.

Ground truth follows P2Rank's own evaluation (relevant ligands from the
`coach420(mlig).ds` MOAD annotation, so ions and buffers do not count).
Everything below is the same size-robust criterion used everywhere else, and both
tools are paired on the 144 structures each of them scored.

| Detector | COACH420 (general, holo) | CryptoBench test fold (cryptic, apo) |
|----------|:------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|
| P2Rank | **93.8%** (135/144) | 63.3% |
| Lacuna (`learned-plm`) | not measured | **66.1%** |
| Lacuna (`learned`) | 86.8% (125/144) | 55.6% |
| Lacuna (`druggability`) | 66.7% (96/144) | - |

The COACH420 column was run with `learned`, the geometry-only strategy, so that
is the row to compare against P2Rank here; `learned-plm` has not been run on this
dataset. Paired on the 144 structures, `learned` trails P2Rank by **-6.9%
(CI -12.5 to -1.4, excludes zero)**, while on cryptic sites `learned-plm` is
nominally ahead of P2Rank (+2.8 points, an interval that spans zero).

**Each tool wins or ties on the task it was built for.** P2Rank is a
general-purpose predictor and is genuinely better at finding sites that are
already open; Lacuna's ensemble machinery buys nothing when nothing needs to
open. The honest reading of "parity with P2Rank" is therefore that parity holds
on cryptic sites specifically, and that a general-purpose detector should be
preferred for general-purpose work. Union of the two is 95.8%.

Absolute recovery is *higher* here than on CryptoBench (86.8% vs 55.6% for the
same strategy) simply because an open pocket is easier to find than a shut one.
Cross-dataset comparisons of the headline number are not meaningful; only the
within-dataset paired differences are.

### The `learned` ranker also wins on always-open sites

`learned` beats `druggability` by **+20.1% (CI +13.2 to +27.1)** on COACH420.
Earlier documentation advised `--rank-by druggability` for orthosteric and
general pocket finding. That advice predated the learned ranker and was wrong by
20 points; `learned` is now the right default for both cryptic and general work.

```bash
python benchmarks/coach420_benchmark.py --limit 150
python benchmarks/compare_p2rank_coach420.py --limit 150   # needs P2Rank on PATH
```

## Why the clustering radius is 2 Å

Alpha points are dilated before connected components are labelled, so points
roughly twice the radius apart fuse into one pocket. At the previous 4 Å setting
that cascaded across connected surface grooves: on CryptoBench 21% of structures
had the true site **fully covered** (median recall 100%) by a pocket carrying
~59 lining residues against ~8 known, far too diffuse to score as localized,
while only 1% of structures missed the site outright.

Halving the radius to 2 Å splits those blobs. It also cuts some genuine sites
apart, lowering the best-achievable overlap, but candidates per structure fall
from ~59 to ~16 and the ranking gain more than compensates. Every variant that
recovered the lost coverage by *adding* candidates lost at top-5:

| Variant | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| 2 Å (shipped) | baseline |
| pooling 4 Å + 2 Å scales | best-achievable overlap back to 100% on solved cases, top-5 worse (~58% projected vs ~61%) |
| lowering `MIN_VOLUME_A3` 80 → 30 | coverage up, top-5 worse (~56-57% projected) |
| adaptive re-split of oversized pockets only | +2.0% CI[+0.4, +4.0]: real but small, and costs a second detection pass |

Candidate count dominates: coverage you cannot rank is worth less than a
smaller, cleaner candidate set.

**The ranker weights are tied to this geometry.** After the radius change the
previous weights scored at the random-selection null on the new pockets. Any
change to detection constants requires refitting via
`benchmarks/train_ranker.py --fit`.

## Where the remaining gap is

Some cluster in the candidate set clears the criterion for 73.7% of test-fold
structures, against the 66.1% that `learned-plm` reaches in the top 5 (55.6%
for the default). The site is usually found
and then out-ranked, and most of the loss sits just outside the cutoff: the
correct cluster is at rank 6-8 for 14 structures, and top-8 recovery is already
64.8%.

### The field can already see most cryptic sites; nobody can rank them

Every tool here reports top-n recovery, which silently adds together two very
different quantities: whether the site was ever proposed, and whether it survived
ranking. Splitting them changes what the comparison means. Held-out test fold,
n=179 to 180, same criterion throughout, per-candidate overlap recorded for every
proposal rather than only the top five:

| tool | candidates | coverage (oracle) | top-5 | of its coverage, converts |
|------|-----------:|------------------:|------:|--------------------------:|
| fpocket | 19.0 | 74.2% | 43.8% | 59% |
| P2Rank | 6.7 | 66.3% | 63.5% | **96%** |
| IF-SitePred | 23.4 | 70.8% | 61.8% | 87% |
| Lacuna (`learned-plm`) | 20.5 | 73.6% | 66.3% | 90% |

**fpocket finds the site as often as Lacuna does.** Its coverage is 74.2% against
our 73.6%, a one-structure difference, and it proposes a similar number of
candidates. The gap between 43.8% and 66.3% at top-5 is ranking, not detection. A
geometric detector from 2009 has already solved the detection half of this problem
about as well as we have.

An earlier version of this table put fpocket at 28.3%. That came from reading its
proposals in the order its output directory listed them, which sorts `pocket10`
before `pocket2`, rather than by fpocket's own rank. The error understated a
competitor by fifteen points and inflated the apparent size of this finding; the
finding survives at the corrected number, but it is smaller than first reported.

P2Rank gets to nearly the same place by the opposite route: the least coverage of
the four, 66.3%, and almost perfect conversion of it. Its advantage was never
finding more, it is proposing 6.7 candidates instead of 20 and ordering them well.
IF-SitePred, published in 2024 on protein language model embeddings, sits inside
the same band on both axes.

The complementarity is the part that reframes the problem:

| detectors unioned | coverage |
|---|---:|
| Lacuna | 73.7% |
| Lacuna + fpocket | 84.9% |
| Lacuna + fpocket + P2Rank | **89.4%** |
| missed by all three | **10.6%** |

The class of cryptic sites invisible to geometric detection is not the ~26% each
tool sees; it is about 11%. The other 15 points are detector-specific: each tool
misses a different set. So coverage is not the scarce resource. **Ranking is.**

Which closes the loop with the pooling result recorded above. Taking the union is
exactly how one would harvest that 89.4%, and taking the union means summing
candidate sets: 20.5 plus 18.9 plus 6.7. Pooling detection scales inside Lacuna
raised coverage 21 points and converted none of it, for the same reason. The field
can already see roughly 89% of these sites and has no way to put them in the top
five.

### Where the headroom is, and what to do about it today

Decomposing the gap between what is currently achieved and what is achievable,
on the held-out test fold:

| | recovery |
|---|---:|
| best single tool, top-5 | 66.5% |
| perfect ranking of that tool's own candidates | 73.7% (+7.3) |
| perfect ranking of three tools' candidates | 89.4% (+22.9) |
| invisible to all three | 10.6% |

Two thirds of the available headroom is not reachable by improving any one
detector's ranking. It requires candidates that a single detector never proposes.

That has a practical consequence, because consensus is free and available now. At
a matched total candidate budget, splitting the budget across three detectors
beats spending it all on the best single one, paired over the same structures:

| candidates shown | union minus best single tool |
|---|---:|
| 3 | -1.7% CI[-6.7, +3.4] |
| 6 | +1.7% CI[-2.8, +6.1] |
| 15 | **+8.4% CI[+3.9, +12.8]** |
| 30 | **+10.1% CI[+5.0, +15.1]** |
| 60 | **+15.6% CI[+10.6, +21.2]** |

Held-out test fold, n=179. The train folds replicate it: +6.4, +10.6 and +14.7 at
15, 30 and 60 over n=748.

The crossover sits between 6 and 15 candidates, and the reason is visible in the
saturation. A single detector stops improving once it reaches its own coverage
ceiling, 73.7% for Lacuna and 66.5% for P2Rank, both of which are hit by a budget
of 15. The union keeps climbing to 89.4% because its ceiling is higher.

So the recommendation is conditional rather than universal, which is why it is
worth stating precisely. **Below roughly ten candidates, use the single best
detector; the union splits the budget too thin to pay off. Above that, a consensus
of detectors strictly dominates, because the single detector has already returned
everything it can find.** Running all three costs about seven seconds per
structure.

### Detection and ranking fail on the same structures

This subfield reports residue-level AUC or AUPRC as its headline number:
CryptoBench, Seq2Pocket and CryptoBank all do. What a user needs is a short
ranked list of pockets. Those are not the same quantity, and nothing published
checks whether one predicts the other.

It does. Scoring each structure's sequence map against its annotated site and
comparing to whether the pipeline surfaced that site in the top 5, residue-level
AUC predicts pocket-level success with a meta-AUC of 0.79 on the held-out test
fold (0.81 on the train folds). The proxy is sound, which was not the expected
result.

The informative part is what happens to *detection* across the same range:

| quartile by residue AUC | top-5 | oracle | ranking converts | site residues |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Q1 (worst) | 20.0% | 42.2% | 47% | 9.6 |
| Q2 | 72.7% | 79.5% | 91% | 14.0 |
| Q3 | 91.1% | 91.1% | 100% | 16.3 |
| Q4 (best) | 82.2% | 82.2% | 100% | 17.0 |

Held-out test fold, n=179; the train folds give the same shape at n=748.

The two failure modes coincide. Where the sequence model cannot localize the
site, the geometric detector usually has not proposed it either: the oracle falls
to 42%. Where sequence is confident, ranking is already solved, converting 96 to
100% of what detection provides. **Between 53 and 60% of all remaining error sits
in the bottom quartile alone**, and that quartile is characterized by small
annotated sites, 9.6 lining residues against 17 in the top quartile.

This bears directly on the current frontier. Combining sequence signal with
geometry is what `learned-plm` does and what Seq2Pocket's P2Rank merge does, and
the premise is that the two are complementary. On the structures where it would
matter they fail together, so the combination improves ordering, worth +10.6%
here, without touching the detection gap. The remaining problem is not cryptic
sites in general; it is small sites that neither signal can place.

One thing this is not: evidence that candidate count explains the hard class. Q1
carries *fewer* candidates than Q4 (19.2 against 23.9). The candidate-count result
elsewhere in this document is interventional, about what happens when a change
adds candidates, and does not appear as a cross-sectional correlation.

These attempts to close it produced no measurable gain, and are recorded so they
are not repeated:

| Attempt | Result |
|---------|--------|
| spatial non-maximum suppression | +0.0% at any radius ≤ 9 Å; -6.0% at 12 Å |
| merging adjacent sub-pockets | 0% of structures are fragmented, so nothing to merge |
| hard-negative mining (added to uniform pairs) | CV +1.9% CI[-0.4, +4.2]; test fold -1.1% |
| gradient boosting instead of linear | +0.7% CI[-1.6, +3.0], not separable |
| P2Rank's per-pocket confidence as a feature | test fold -1.1% CI[-4.5, +2.2] |
| pruning the candidate set before ranking | +0.4% CI[+0.0, +1.1] in-sample on the train folds, best of a full single-feature threshold sweep |
| buriedness-weighted lining (buried core only) | monotonically negative; -9.9% CI[-17.4, -2.5] at the deepest 10% |
| local energetic frustration as a site signal | residue-level AUC 0.51, chance (configurational variant untested) |
| multi-crystal experimental ensembles | candidates per target 11.7 -> 27.2 at equal conformer count |

Pruning deserves its own note, because the arithmetic looks so inviting: the
median structure carries 19 candidates and top-5 is 26% of that, so shrinking
the haystack ought to convert oracle into recovery. The candidate set really
does compress. A `plm_mean >= 0.29` filter drops 45% of all candidates while
losing 1.3% of true positives, and `plm_frac >= 0.15` drops 40% for 1.8%. The
condition everyone hopes for is met, and it still buys nothing.

The reason is that pruning and ranking read the same features. The candidates a
filter removes are the ones the ranker had already pushed down: the median rank
of a pruned candidate is 21, and only 2.7% of them sit in the top 5 at all.
Removing the tail of a list cannot change its head. Of the 463 false positives
that actually outrank a true site under `learned-plm`, that 45% prune removes
14%. Converting every convertible miss would take 295 *specific* removals, 3.1%
of the pool chosen exactly, which is a description of a better ranker rather
than of a filter.

Geometric filters are worse than useless: dropping the smallest 5% of candidates
by volume costs 13.6% of the true positives, because true sites concentrate in
the large-volume tail. This is the same fact that sinks a lower `MIN_VOLUME_A3`,
seen from the other end, and it is consistent with STILL_BIG dominating the
detection gap.

One combination does gain: the geometry-only `learned` ranker improves +3.6%
CI[+1.8, +5.6] under a `plm_mean` prune. That is sequence information reaching a
ranker that lacks it, not a property of pruning, and the result is still no
better than simply using the sequence-aware ranker (-0.4% CI[-2.4, +1.6] against
`learned-plm`). Nothing to adopt.

The P2Rank-confidence row is the informative one. If per-point scoring were the missing
*ranking* ingredient, handing the ranker P2Rank's own opinion of each cluster
would have helped. It did not. P2Rank's advantage lies in proposing different
candidates, not in ordering ours better.

### Trimming a pocket is not the same as dividing it

Four separate attempts have tried to fix the oversized-pocket class by making
each pocket's residue set smaller: a cross-conformer consensus threshold, a
hotspot-core radius, and now weighting lining residues by the burial of the
cavity voxels they touch. All three trim. All three failed. Measured on 121
train-fold structures, keeping only the most buried fraction of each cavity's
voxels when deriving lining residues:

| kept | mean lining | best Jaccard | oracle at Jaccard >= 0.30 |
|------|------------:|-------------:|--------------------------:|
| all (shipped) | 20.3 | 0.337 | 60.3% |
| deepest 75% | 19.4 | 0.338 | -0.8% |
| deepest 50% | 17.8 | 0.341 | +0.8% CI[-3.3, +5.0] |
| deepest 25% | 15.1 | 0.321 | -5.0% |
| deepest 10% | 12.2 | 0.301 | -9.9% CI[-17.4, -2.5] |

Monotone: mild trimming is neutral, aggressive trimming does significant harm.
An annotated site is the set of residues contacting a bound ligand, and a ligand
is not confined to the deepest part of a cavity, so residues at the mouth are
frequently in the true site. Trimming removes them from the intersection faster
than it removes false ones from the union, and the Jaccard falls.

Worth stating because a fourth attempt at the same class *did* work: watershed
splitting, which raised CV recovery +2.1% CI[+0.7, +3.7]. The difference is that
a split keeps every lining residue and reassigns it to the right sub-pocket,
while trimming discards residues outright. The oversized-pocket problem is a
boundary-placement problem, not a size problem, and the distinction predicts
which attempts are worth making.

First implementation of this used `MOUTH_DEPTH_A` as the core threshold, since
that is the depth `mouth_frac` already uses. It is a no-op: 93% of cavity voxels
lie deeper than it, so the "core" is the whole pocket and the lining sets come out
identical to three significant figures. The quantile above is what actually bites.

### Residue-level independence does not survive pocket-level aggregation

Three per-residue signals were tested as ranker features, on the reasoning that a
signal which fails on *different* structures from the sequence head would add
where it matters. The reasoning was sound and the conclusion was still wrong, in
a way worth recording because it applies to any future candidate.

AlphaFold pLDDT is the clearest case. It separates annotated site residues at
0.661 inverted, close to the 0.68 CryptoBench reports for pLM embeddings, and its
per-structure AUC is uncorrelated with the sequence head's (Spearman -0.014). In
the quartile where the sequence head collapses to 0.592 it holds at 0.630, which
is exactly the complementarity the earlier analysis said was missing.

Aggregated over lining residues it adds nothing: **-0.3% CI[-1.1, +0.4]** against
the shipped feature set, leave-one-fold-out over 721 train-fold structures.

The reason shows up in the pocket-level correlations. `plddt_mean` correlates
+0.358 with `bur_raw`, +0.322 with `enc` and +0.265 with `depth`, and those
existing features discriminate positives just as well (`bur_raw` 0.677 inverted
against `plddt_mean`'s 0.658). It also correlates -0.385 with `plm_mean` at the
pocket level despite the per-structure independence. Averaging a per-residue
quantity over a pocket's lining couples it to how big and how buried that pocket
is, and the ranker already models both.

So per-structure independence of two signals says nothing about the marginal value
of the second once both are aggregated the same way. Any future per-residue
feature should be checked for correlation against `bur_raw`, `enc` and `depth`
*after* aggregation, before a pipeline run is spent on it.

For the record, the other two:

| signal | residue AUC | independence vs pLM | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| pLDDT | 0.661 | -0.014 | -0.3% CI[-1.1,+0.4] at pocket level |
| ESSA (elastic-network essential sites) | 0.623 | +0.091 | flat across quartiles; ~7s/structure |
| local frustration | 0.509 | n/a | chance, never reached pocket level |

ESSA clears the residue-level gate that frustration failed, and it is close to
independent, but it does not hold up where the sequence head fails, which was the
whole reason to want it. Given pLDDT was both stronger and better placed and still
converted nothing, ESSA was not taken to a pocket-level run.

### Local energetic frustration

Energy landscape theory says a fold's minimally frustrated contacts form its
stable core while frustrated ones are where the structure can rearrange, and a
2026 kinase study reports orthosteric sites sitting in minimally frustrated
regions against allosteric sites in neutrally frustrated ones, framing frustration
as a determinant of which sites a predictor can see at all. If that holds, it
would explain the UNCOVERED class rather than merely patch it, and it costs no
extra candidates because it is a per-residue score.

It does not hold here. Frustration was computed with `frustratometer` 0.3.2 on
699 train-fold structures, 9760 annotated site residues against 197009 others:

| variant | site mean | other mean | AUC |
|---------|----------:|-----------:|----:|
| single-residue | +0.069 | +0.097 | 0.509 |
| mutational | +0.186 | +0.229 | 0.516 |

That is chance. For scale, CryptoBench reports 0.68 for separating cryptic from
non-cryptic residues using protein language model embeddings alone. Band
enrichments are flat too: annotated site residues are 1.03x enriched for highly
frustrated and 1.03x for neutrally frustrated, so there is nothing for a
pocket-level aggregate to average over. The one non-null signal is mutational
frustration's highly frustrated band at 1.86x, but that band holds 2.6% of site
residues, far too few to move a ranking.

Tested at the residue level deliberately, before building any pocket feature: if
site residues do not separate from the rest of the protein, no aggregation of them
into a pocket score can separate either. That gate cost about an hour and saved
the full detection-change cycle.

Scope of this negative, stated precisely. It covers the single-residue and
mutational indices. **Configurational** frustration was not tested: it costs 22 to
63 seconds per structure, six to thirteen hours across this set, and it is the
variant most directly tied to conformational rearrangement, so it remains the one
version of this idea still open.

### Multi-crystal experimental ensembles

Other PDB depositions of the same UniProt, used as the conformational ensemble in
place of normal-mode sampling. This is the only source of genuinely different
conformers available at no compute cost, and NMA's oracle asymptotes regardless of
how many conformers are drawn, so it is the obvious thing to try.

Both arms were run at the *same* conformer count, because adding conformers is
the move that has failed every previous time. At equal budget, on 23 train-fold
targets, real crystal ensembles more than double the candidate set:

| | NMA | multi-crystal |
|---|---:|---:|
| candidates per target | 11.7 | 27.2 |
| mean best Jaccard | 0.236 | 0.259 |
| oracle at Jaccard >= 0.25 | 43.5% | 39.1% |

Candidate inflation at fixed conformer count is the finding. Crystal structures
of one protein differ enough in loop conformation and in which regions are
resolved that their pockets do not cluster across the ensemble the way
normal-mode conformers do, so each frame contributes its own candidates instead
of reinforcing shared ones. Given that coverage bought by adding candidates has
never converted here, that is disqualifying on its own. It survives restricting
frames to those matching at least 90% of the reference atoms, so it is not an
artifact of chimeric frames, which are a real hazard: unmatched atoms keep their
*reference* coordinates, and the backend only warns below 50%.

Two limits on this. n=23 makes the oracle comparison genuinely inconclusive
rather than proven flat. And these are the PDB-richest targets in the train
folds, so it is a best case rather than a typical one.

Coverage is the other problem, independent of any of that. 99% of targets have
another entry for the same UniProt and 90% have one that is not a CryptoBench
holo partner, but excluding entries with anything bound near the annotated site
leaves roughly 30% of targets with the five conformers this needs. For 1a4u it
leaves none: every other deposition of that protein has a ligand at the site,
which is the reason it is in a cryptic-pocket benchmark in the first place.

The leakage screen is the reusable part, and it validates: told only the site
residues, it independently flags all seven other depositions of 1a4u as bound at
the site, rediscovering their holo status without being given it. It rejects
entries whose residue-numbering correspondence cannot be established rather than
trusting them, which costs coverage and is what makes the rest of the claim
sound. Identifying the corresponding chain has to be part of that: for a
ribosomal target, reading site residue numbers from whichever chain comes first
returns rRNA nucleotides and rejects every entry for the wrong reason.

## Speed (NMA backend, no GPU)

Wall clock for the full pipeline (ensemble generation, per-conformer detection,
clustering, scoring, ranking) at 20 conformers on a laptop CPU.

| Protein | Residues | Time |
|---------|---------:|-----:|
| Interleukin-2 (1M47) | 122 | 0.7s |
| T4 lysozyme (1L90) | 162 | 0.9s |
| K-Ras (4OBE) | 339 | 1.1s |
| Glucokinase (1V4S) | 448 | 3.8s |
| PKM2 (1ZJH) | 507 | 4.5s |
| HIV-1 RT (1HMV) | 536 (chain A) | 7.3s |

The geometric descriptors added for the ranker cost roughly 15% of detection
time and reuse grids the detector already builds.

## Training and re-fitting the ranker

```bash
python benchmarks/train_ranker.py --dump features.jsonl --folds train-0,train-1,train-2,train-3
python benchmarks/train_ranker.py --cv  --dump features.jsonl   # model selection
python benchmarks/train_ranker.py --fit --dump features.jsonl --test-dump test.jsonl
```

Model selection uses leave-one-fold-out cross-validation across the train folds,
never the test fold, which is touched once for the final number. Two choices
were made that way: the geometry features are worth +6.9 points
(CI [+4.0, +9.7]), and training on within-structure pairs rather than individual
clusters adds +2.4 (CI [+0.7, +4.2]). A fit on shuffled labels scores at the
random null, confirming the gain is signal rather than an artifact of the
evaluation.
