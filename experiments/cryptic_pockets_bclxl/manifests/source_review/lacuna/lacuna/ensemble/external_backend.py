"""Use a conformational ensemble somebody else generated.

Lacuna's own samplers are a convenience, not the point. The detection, clustering
and ranking stages do not care where the conformers came from, so the most useful
thing the tool can do is consume a better ensemble than it can produce. An
elastic-network model cannot generate large hinge or interface motions; a long
molecular dynamics trajectory or a generative model such as AlphaFlow or BioEmu
can, and this backend is how that output gets in.

Accepts either shape ensembles usually arrive in:

  * one multi-model file (NMR deposition, trajectory exported to PDB, generative
    model output written as models)
  * a directory of single-structure files, one per conformer

Atom correspondence
-------------------
External frames rarely match the reference atom-for-atom. A predicted model may
be missing a disordered loop the crystal resolved, or number residues from a
construct rather than the deposition. Frames are therefore matched on
``(chain_id, res_seq, atom_name)`` rather than by position, and any reference atom
a frame does not contain keeps its reference coordinate. That degrades gracefully
instead of silently pairing the wrong atoms, which is the failure that would
quietly corrupt every pocket downstream.

A frame matching very little of the reference is reported rather than used
silently, because that almost always means a numbering mismatch rather than a
genuinely different conformation.
