"""OpenMM implicit-solvent MD ensemble backend.

Runs short MD trajectories at physiological (or elevated) temperature using the
GBn2 implicit-solvent model. Each snapshot is an independent conformer. Elevated
temperature is a light "enhanced sampling" knob for opening transient cavities
that plain 310 K sampling leaves shut.

The backend feeds detection the same atom set (and order) as the rest of the
pipeline: it starts from ``load_structure`` (which drops HETATM/water and can
select a single chain), so the force field never sees ligands/ions, and it maps
the MD positions back onto the original heavy-atom order by (chain, resSeq,
atom-name). Atoms with no MD match (rare - e.g. an alternate-name terminal atom)
keep their input coordinate.

Requires: pip install "lacuna-pockets[openmm]"  (openmm + pdbfixer)
