"""Druggability scoring for detected pockets.

Based on the empirical model from:
  Halgren (2009) J. Chem. Inf. Model. 49(2):377-389
  Schmidtke & Barril (2010) J. Med. Chem. 53(15):5858-5867

Score components:
  - Volume: Gaussian reward centered at 300 Å³ (too small = can't bind drug,
             too large = not selective)
  - Enclosure: linear reward for buried pockets (open = solvent competition)
  - Hydrophobicity: linear reward (hydrophobic pockets drive binding via entropy)
  - Aromaticity: bonus for π-stacking contacts (common in drug-protein binding)

All components are [0,1] and combined as a weighted average.
