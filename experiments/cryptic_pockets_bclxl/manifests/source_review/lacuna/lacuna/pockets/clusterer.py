"""Cluster pockets across the conformational ensemble.

Each conformer produces a list of Pocket objects. This module:
  1. Pools all pockets across all conformers.
  2. Clusters by centroid proximity using DBSCAN (eps=5 Å, min_samples=1).
  3. Computes per-cluster statistics: persistence, druggability, volume
     dynamics, a continuous crypticity score, and consensus residues.
  4. Ranks clusters by a configurable strategy (see ``rank_by``).
  5. Flags clusters as "cryptic" if persistence < 0.9 (not open in all conformers).

# reliably (KRAS switch-II, say) has high persistence, so a "persistence < 0.9"

# CryptoBench (57.0% vs 17.8% on the held-out test fold, n=180). "crypticity" is the previous
# default and ranks purely by how much a site opens relative to the input;
# "druggability" ranks by peak open-state druggability (preferable for always-open
# / orthosteric sites); the legacy "persistence" strategy multiplies druggability
# by persistence, demoting the very transient pockets the tool targets; "balanced"

# ── learned ranker ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A linear model over cluster features, fitted to predict whether a cluster is the
# true binding site under the size-robust criterion (Jaccard >= 0.25).
#
# Why this exists: on CryptoBench the analytic strategies above rank at the
# random-selection null. Measured on 150 shuffled structures, an oracle over all
# clusters recovers 75.3% of sites, picking 5 clusters at random recovers 13.0%,
# and ranking by crypticity recovers 12.7%. The detector already produces a
# well-localized pocket for roughly three quarters of structures; the analytic
# scores simply cannot find it among a median of 64 candidates (median 1 of which
# is correct).
#
# Trained on within-structure pairs (linear RankNet) over 741 CryptoBench
# train-fold structures, and measured on the dataset's own held-out test fold
# (180 structures). Splitting on CryptoBench's folds rather than at random keeps
# homologous proteins out of the evaluation.
#
# Two choices were made by cross-validation over the train folds, never on the
# test fold: the geometry features below are worth ~+6.9 points (CI +4.0 to +9.7),
# and training on pairs rather than on individual clusters adds a further +2.4
# (CI +0.7 to +4.2). Pairs are the better fit to the task because the decision is
# "which of this protein's ~64 candidates is the site", and differencing two
# clusters from the same structure cancels every protein-level nuisance term.
# Gradient boosting was not separable from this linear model (+0.7, CI -1.6 to
# +3.0), so the simpler, dependency-free scorer ships.
#
# Test-fold top-5 recovery 57.0% (95% CI 49.7-64.2), a paired gain of +24.0
# (CI +16.2 to +32.4) over the ranking the same pipeline produces without it. An
# identical fit on shuffled labels scores 38.0%, well below, confirming the gain
# is signal rather than an artifact of the evaluation.
#
# The weights are specific to the detector geometry they were fitted on. Halving
# CLUSTER_RADIUS_A changed pocket sizes enough that the previous weights fell to
# the random null on the new pockets, so any change to detection constants means
# refitting via benchmarks/train_ranker.py --fit.
#
# Standardization is folded into the weights so scoring is a dot product on raw
# features: no scikit-learn or other runtime dependency, and the coefficients stay
# readable. Retrain with benchmarks/train_ranker.py.
# Every feature here is invariant to the size of the ensemble. The obvious
# alternatives are not: a raw member count scales with the conformer count
# outright, and a max or min over members drifts into the tails as more conformers
# are drawn. A model fitted at one ensemble size then misreads another, which cost
# 17.5 points of recovery at 80 conformers against the 20 it was fitted on, with
# no error and no warning. Quantiles and per-conformer rates carry the same
# information and hold steady, so --conformers is safe to change.
