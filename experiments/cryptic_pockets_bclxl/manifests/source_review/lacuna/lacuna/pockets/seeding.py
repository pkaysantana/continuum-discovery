"""Propose pocket locations from sequence where geometry proposes none.

A cryptic site in its apo form often has no concavity for an alpha-sphere detector
to find, which is the definition of the problem rather than a shortcoming of the
detector. On a single structure that caps coverage at 46.5% of CryptoBench targets
against P2Rank's 61.9% on identical input, and the shortfall is entirely detection:
at one conformer the ranker already converts 97.6% of the coverage it is given, so
there is nothing left to win by ranking better.

The sequence head does not need a pocket to be open. Handing its highest-scoring
residues to ``characterize_pockets`` (the entry point the P2Rank fusion path uses)
produces proposals described by the same geometry code as detected ones, so the two
are on one scale in the clusterer.

Measured on CryptoBench, one conformer, held-out test fold: +8.5% CI[+4.0, +13.6]
top-5 recovery with the sequence ranker, from 18 structures gained against 3 lost,
for 1.2 extra candidates per structure.

When this helps, and when it does not
-------------------------------------
Added coverage converts to recovery only while the candidate set is small. Holding
this intervention fixed and varying ensemble size, so that candidate count is the
only thing changing:

    candidates    oracle gain    top-5 gain    converts
    6.6 -> 7.8      +14.3%         +12.3%         86%
    14.1 -> 15.3     +6.4%          +5.5%         85%
    17.5 -> 18.7     +5.2%          +2.7%         51%
    21.1 -> 22.2     +3.9%          +2.0%         52%

Conversion holds near 85% up to roughly fifteen candidates and halves above it. So
seeding substitutes for conformers rather than adding to them: at five conformers
it closes the whole gap to the twenty-conformer ensemble (-0.1% CI[-2.9, +2.6]) at
a third of the wall clock, while at twenty it adds nothing separable from zero.
That is why this is opt-in and why turning it on is worth pairing with a smaller
ensemble rather than layering it on top of a large one.

        Residue sequence number to the sequence head's probability, as returned by

        Coordinates for the conformer being seeded. Defaults to the structure's own
