"""Grid-based binding pocket detection using alpha-sphere-inspired segmentation.

Algorithm:
  1. Build protein occupancy grid (VDW spheres).
  2. Compute Euclidean distance transform: dist[i,j,k] = Å to nearest protein atom.
  3. Find LOCAL MAXIMA of the distance field inside the interaction zone.
     Each local max is an "alpha point" - a sphere that fits snugly into a
     protein concavity and touches multiple atoms on all sides.  This is the
     core idea behind fpocket / CASTp.
  4. Cluster nearby alpha points into pockets (DBSCAN-style dilation + labelling).
  5. Grow each pocket cluster outward into its surrounding interaction zone
     to compute volume, lining residues, and druggability features.

This correctly segments the protein into DISTINCT POCKETS rather than treating
the entire surface as one connected region.
