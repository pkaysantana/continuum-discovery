<p align="center"><em>A protein breathes through Lacuna's conformational ensemble, and a cryptic
pocket appears. Adenosine kinase along its lowest normal mode (Lacuna's NMA backend): as the
interdomain cleft opens, the substrate pocket (blue) is exposed and 2-fluoroadenosine (orange,
the crystallographic ligand from holo 2PKK) docks into it. The motion is Lacuna's own mode-0
ensemble; the ligand is shown at its bound pose.</em></p>

Most protein structure predictors return one static conformation. But many
disease-relevant proteins are called undruggable not because they are
biologically intractable, but because no pocket is visible in their ground
state. K-Ras was considered undruggable for thirty years until a transient
cryptic pocket was found beneath its switch-II region. That pocket now backs
sotorasib and adagrasib.

Lacuna finds those pockets. It generates a conformational ensemble from any
input structure, detects pockets in every conformer, clusters them across the
ensemble to surface sites that appear only transiently, and ranks them with a
fitted model.

```bash
lacuna discover kras.pdb --conformers 20 --emit-boltz-constraints --emit-vina-boxes
```

## Install

```bash
pip install lacuna-pockets
```

Optional extras, for better conformational sampling or the sequence-assisted
ranker:

```bash
pip install "lacuna-pockets[openmm]"   # 100ps implicit-solvent MD
pip install "lacuna-pockets[plm]"      # PLM-assisted ranker (PyTorch, ESM-2)
pip install "lacuna-pockets[boltz]"    # Boltz-2 diffusion sampling (experimental, GPU)
pip install "lacuna-pockets[all]"      # everything
```

Requires Python 3.10+. The default backend needs no GPU, no force field and no
model weights.

<p align="center"><em>Apo BCL-XL (1LXL): a Lacuna-detected pocket (blue) opening onto the
groove where ABT-737 (orange, from the holo structure 2YXJ) binds, a site never shown to
the detector. With <code>--detector surface-fusion</code> this site is recovered at rank 2,
Jaccard 0.36, centroid 5.6 Å. The default <code>alpha</code> detector places it third and
does not clear the size-robust bar, which is the specialisation this release is about.</em></p>

## Quick start

```bash
lacuna discover protein.pdb --conformers 20
```

Writes a ranked `pocket_report.json` plus, on request, Boltz YAML constraints
and AutoDock Vina boxes ready for docking. Full options in
**[docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md)**.

## How it works

1. **Ensemble generation.** N conformers from elastic-network normal mode
   analysis (default), OpenMM implicit-solvent MD, or Boltz-2 diffusion sampling.
2. **Pocket detection.** Grid-based alpha-point analysis per conformer: distance
   transform, local maxima in the 1.4-5.5 A interaction zone, clustered into
   candidates.
3. **Cross-ensemble clustering.** Greedy centroid merging matches corresponding
   pockets across every conformer, turning transient cavities into persistent
   sites with their own statistics.
4. **Druggability scoring.** Gaussian volume reward centred at 300 A³, plus
   enclosure, hydrophobicity and aromaticity (Halgren 2009), scored per conformer.
5. **Ranking.** A fitted linear model over 23 geometric and ensemble-derived
   features orders the sites. Each also carries a continuous crypticity score.

## Results

On CryptoBench's designated test fold, Lacuna recovers **55.6%** of known
cryptic sites in its top five with the zero-dependency default and **66.1%**
with the optional PLM-assisted ranker, and the true site is present in the
candidate set for up to 92% of structures.

### Recovery by configuration

Cryptic-pocket recovery on CryptoBench's held-out test fold, under the
size-robust criterion (Jaccard >= 0.25, or centroid within 4 A of the site).

| Configuration | Top-5 recovery | Site found (coverage) |
|---|:--:|:--:|
| Default (CPU-only, zero-dependency) | 55.6% | 73.7% |
| + PLM reranker | 66.1% | 73.7% |
| `surface-fusion` detector | 73.9%¹ | 86.4%¹ |
| Union across detectors | n/a | **92.2%** |

¹ Held-out surface-fusion evaluation at 5 conformers (n=184); the other rows use
the 20-conformer cohort (n=180).
